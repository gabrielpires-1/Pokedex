# Trilha JS Developer - Pokedex

## This project is a pokedex which can be accessed by a desktop or mobile, developed on the JavaScript course of DIO (Digital Innovation One). The project used 3 programming languages: JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

### It was very good for me, because I could practice and learn JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Furthermore it was the first time developing web, using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I enjoyed it a lot and learned a lot of useful things in WEB development, just like using API (PokeAPI), QueryString, HTTP server, Headers, Body, Status Code, Normalize CSS, and other things to make the application useful.
