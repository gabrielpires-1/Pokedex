### Trilha JS Developer - Pokedex

## This project is a pokedex which can be accessed by a desktop or mobile, developed on the JavaScript course of DIO (Digital Innovation One). The project used 3 programming languages: JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

# It was very good for me, because I could practice and learn JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Furthermore it was the first time developing web, and I enjoyed it a lot!
